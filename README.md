# Incident-Atlas-Pro
Incident Atlas Pro turns public postmortems and open incident reports into a searchable incident memory. It uses hybrid search (keyword + embeddings) and a lightweight knowledge graph to find similar outages, surface root causes/fixes, and show evidence-backed results with citations in a deployable full-stack app.
